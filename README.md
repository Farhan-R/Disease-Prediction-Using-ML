# Disease-Prediction-Using-ML
Disease Prediction software using machine learning with tkinter interface

In competitive environment of economic development the mankind has involved so much that he/she is not concerned about health. 

According to research there are 40% people who ignores about general disease which leads to harmful disease later.

The main reason of ignorance is laziness and no time to take an appointment and consult the doctor which later results into fatal disease.

The main motive to develop this project is that a user can sit at their convenient place and have a check-up of their health. 

This Disease Prediction is completely done with the help of Machine Learning

The UI is designed in such a simple way that everyone can easily operate on it and can have a check-up.

FEATURES:

 #This Project will predict the diseases of the patients based on the symptoms and other general information using the datasets.

 #This is done based on the previous datasets of the hospitals so after comparing it can provide up to 80% of accurate results.

 #The disease is predicted using three algorithms and the user has to enter the symptoms from the given drop-down menu, in order to get correct accuracy, the user has to enter  maximum possible symptoms.

 #To make application more user friendly, simple and convenient UI is designed

 #Here the user has to register first, in order to use the prediction and then login to the system using the credentials such as username and password.
